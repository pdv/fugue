# webcv

ClojureScript music programming environment

## Overview

Webcv is build on operators, which produce synthdefs. Rather than directly calling the Web MIDI and Web Audio APIs, these synthdefs are loom graph representations of an audio/midi setup.
```
(require '[webcv.audio :as a])
(a/sin-osc 440)
```
To build a synthdef, call `synthdef/make-synth` with a context (audio, midi, or both) and a synthdef.

#### IO

```
(out channel node)
(in channel)
```

#### Aduio

```
(out & ins)
(gain in & gains)
(mix & ins)
(const & offsets)
(sin-osc freq detune)
(saw freq detune)
(sqare freq detune)
(tri-osc freq detune)
(lpf frequency q)
(bpf frequency q)
(hpf frequency q)
```

#### MIDI

```
(midi-in name)  ; Acquires a midi channel
(hz midi)       ; Produces a frequency channel from a midi channel
(gate midi)     ; Produces a gate channel from a midi channel
```

#### Envelopes

Envelopes are defined by an envdef and triggered by a gate channel.
```
(adsr a d s r)
(perc a d)
(env-gen env gate scale bias)
```

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
